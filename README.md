# Mall Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## Overview

This notebook is part of **Task 2** of my **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship**.  
The objective of this task is to apply **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to analyze customer behavior and segment customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing patterns.

Customer segmentation plays a vital role in data-driven decision-making, helping businesses design targeted marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and increase profitability.

## Problem Statement

The dataset represents customers of a shopping mall and includes features such as:

- Customer Gender and Age
- Annual income
- Spending behavior

The goal is to identify **natural groupings (clusters)** among customers without predefined labels and interpret these clusters to extract actionable business insights.

## What This Project Covers

This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for customer segmentation, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Analyzing distributions and relationships between customer attributes.

- **Feature Selection & Preparation**  
  Selecting relevant features that influence customer behavior.

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  Applying **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers into distinct groups.

- **Optimal Cluster Identification**  
  Using the **Elbow Method** to determine the ideal number of clusters.

- **Cluster Visualization**  
  Visual representation of customer segments for better interpretability.

- **Insight Extraction**  
  Interpreting clusters to understand different types of customers, such as:
  - High-spending customers
  - Budget-conscious customers
  - Potential premium and target customer groups
